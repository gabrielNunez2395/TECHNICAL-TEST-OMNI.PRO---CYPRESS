# CYPRESS PROJECT PROPOSAL - TECHNICAL TEST OMNI.PRO

## Description
This automation is intended to serve as the basis for an automation project in cypress. In this project we validate a store test page ‚Äúadvantageonlineshopping‚Äù by making distributed test cases to run on both desktop and mobile.

### Cases

- Validating the category section, selecting the Laptops category.
- Adding a product to the cart.
- Searching for a product from the search input.
- Validate the title of the page.

#### Note
* The last three cases were performed with the ScreenPlay test design pattern.
* As a final deliverable an html report is created.
